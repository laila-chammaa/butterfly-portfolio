        <p>
          I’m passionate about all things web, from frontend and backend to UI
          and UX design. But I felt like I was focusing too much on the front
          end and wanted to explore other things more, so I’m currently also
          learning about networks and servers as well as website performance
          with a frontend masters course. (LANGUAGES!) I’m an avid reader. It’s
          actually kind of a family hobby, my mom cultivated our love for books
          since we were young. I’ve read almost 400 books in diverse genres.
          I've also recently started playing the piano (my sisters are
          constantly annoyed by the sound of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts
          soundtracks) so I’m really excited about that.
